    <div id="exerciseboxlegs">
    <ul>
        <li><b>Squats:</b> A classic compound movement that targets the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, lower your hips down as if sitting back into a chair, and then return to the starting position</li>
        <li><b>Lunges: </b>Another great compound exercise that works your quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. Take a step forward or backward, lower your body until both knees are bent at 90 degrees, and then push through the front heel to return to the starting position</li>
        <li><b>Deadlifts: </b>While primarily targeting the hamstrings and glutes, deadlifts also engage the lower back and core. Bend at the hips while keeping your back straight, grab a barbell or weights, and stand up by extending your hips</li>
        <li><b>Leg Press:</b> Using a leg press machine, push the weight upward with your legs. This exercise primarily targets your quadriceps but also engages your hamstrings and glutes</li>
        <li><b>Step-Ups:</b> Use a bench or sturdy surface to step up and down. This exercise works your quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. You can hold weights for added resistance.</li>
        <li><b>Calf Raises: </b>Stand on the edge of a step or a platform, then raise and lower your heels to target the calf muscles.

        </li>
        <li><b>Wall Sits: </b>A static exercise that engages your quadriceps. Press your back against a wall and lower your body until your thighs are parallel to the ground, as if sitting in an invisible chair</li>
        <li>
            <b>Hamstring Curls: </b>If you have access to a leg curl machine, this exercise isolates the hamstrings. Lie face down and curl your heels toward your glutes.</li>
        <li><b>Bulgarian Split Squats:</b> This variation of lunges involves elevating one foot behind you on a bench or platform while performing a lunge motion with the other leg. It targets the quadriceps and glutes.</li>
    </ul></div>
